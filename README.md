site-mapper
===========
Site Map Generation in node.js

## Installation ##

This module is intended to be used as a dependency in a website specific 
site map building project.  Add the module to the "dependencies" section
of a package.json file:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "site-mapper": ">= 0.0.7"
}
```

There is nothing stopping you from installing it locally and editing the embedded
configuration files, but that is not the intent.

    npm install site-mapper


## Tests ##

make test

This should install all dependencies, compile the coffeescript files into
javascript and run the test suite
